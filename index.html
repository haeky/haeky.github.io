    Hi, my name is Laurent. I am currently studying in École de technologie supérieure in Montréal in automated production engineering.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    I am a web developer. I started developing in PHP but then I switched to Java during college. Right now, I am working on some projects in Ruby on Rails and I am falling in love with it! I am still learning, one piece of code at a time ... 
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    The things I enjoy the most in life are cooking, good music (especially ska), and doing new stuff I haven't done before.
