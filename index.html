    Hi, my name is Laurent. I am a web developer and a graduate from École de technologie supérieure in Montréal in automated production engineering in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
  While studying, I had the opportunity to work on multiple projets that helped me learn various things in the field of computer science and event management. From everything from system administrator, web development to sponsorship management, I had the chance to work on everything!
  </p>
  <p>
  The things I enjoy the most in life are cooking, <a href="http://runkeeper.com/user/Haeky/profile" target="_blank">running</a>, and <a href="http://500px.com/haeky" target="_blank">photography</a>.
